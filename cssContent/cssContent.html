				<h2>Explainer</h2>
				<p>According to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/F87.html">WCAG Common Failure F87</a> you shouldn't use CSS to inject important content.  This page is to test that.</p>
				<h3>Content on plain content</h3>
				<p id="p1" class="c1">This is a basic paragraph with a <code>::before</code>.</p>

				<h3>Content on non-form tabable content with <code>tabindex=0</code></h3>
				<p id="p2" tabindex="0" class="c1">This is a tabable paragraph with some <code>::before</code> content</p>

				<h3>Content with link with content</h3>
				<p id="p3">This is a paragraph with a <a href="#" id="a1" class="c1">a link with <code>::before</code> content</a>.</p>

				<h3>Content with a button</h3>
				<button id="b1" class="c1">A Button</button>

				<h3>Text input with content</h3>
				<label for="txt1" id="lbl1" class="c1">Enter some text</label>
				<input id="txt1">

				<h3>Fieldset with with content</h3>
				<fieldset class="c1">
					<legend>Pick one</legend>
					<input id="r1" name="rb" type="radio"><label for="r1">Option 1</label>
					<input id="r2" name="rb" type="radio"><label for="r2">Option 2</label>
					<input id="r3" name="rb" type="radio"><label for="r3">Option 3</label>
				</fieldset>
				<h3>Fieldset with legend with content</h3>
				<fieldset>
					<legend class="c1">Pick some</legend>
					<input id="c1" type="checkbox"><label for="c1">Option 1</label>
					<input id="c2" type="checkbox"><label for="c2">Option 2</label>
					<input id="c3" type="checkbox"><label for="c3">Option 3</label>
				</fieldset>

				<h3>Submit button with content</h3>
				<input type="submit" class="c1" value="Click me">

					<dd>
						<dl>
							<dt>Safari, Chrome, Firefox</dt>
							<dd>In browse mode (control+option+arrow keys) the psuedo-content is always read if it is visible ("star stuff...".)  When tabbing, it's read when it's visible, except on <code>&lt;fieldset&gt;</code>.  But it is read as part of the <code>&lt;legend&gt;</code>.</dd>

							<dd>In browse mode (swipe left/right) the psuedo-content is always read if it is visible ("star stuff...".)  When using the rotor (links/form controls), it's read when it's visible, except on <code>&lt;fieldset&gt;</code> even when it's part of the <code>&lt;legend&gt;</code>.  But this is a VoiceOver iOS issue; the <code>&lt;legend&gt;</code> is never read when swiping up/down with rotor on Form Controls.</dd>

						<dd>In browse mode, the psuedo-content is always read if it's visible.  When you get to the <code>&lt;fieldset&gt;</code>, first it reads "group start" then when you press <kbd>down arrow-key</kbd> it says "star stuff".  When it's applied to the <code>&lt;legend&gt;</code> you hear "grouping start star stuff pick some" without having to hit <kbd>down arrow-key</kbd>.  In Forms Mode (tabbing through the page) it's read in all places except with it's applied to <code>&lt;fieldset&gt;</code>, but it is read when aplied to <code>&lt;legend&gt;</code> as part of the <code>&lt;legend&gt;</code> text.</dd>

				<h2>Conclusions and Recommendations</h2>
				<p>With the exception of <code>&lt;fieldset&gt;</code>s and <code>&lt;legend&gt;</code>s, adding text content with CSS actually enjoys robust support as of early 2022!  But <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/F87.html">WCAG Common Failure F87</a> still exists. I don't want to tell anyone to disgregard that Common Failure.  There may be other tests I'm not running, like voice control, or custom stylesheets.</p>
				<p>Incidentally, the User Agent Support notes for F87 says: <q cite="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/Techniques/ua-notes/failures#F87">:before and :after are not supported by IE7 and lower</q>.  In 2022, whow's even using IE, let along IE7 or below?</p>
				<p>Then again, the Common Failure text says:<q cite="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/F87.html">For users who need to customize or turn off style information in order to view content according to their needs, assistive technologies may not be able to access the information that is inserted using CSS. </q>.  So this isn't even about screen readers. I wonder how many real-world examples there are of this.  So many websites use CSS styles to hide and reveal content that turning off styling is going to have major implications.  In fact, this pattern is so common in forms, that no customizable system worth its salt would ignore <code>::before</code> and <code>::after</code> content.</p>
				<p>Also don't add <code>tabindex="0"</code> to non-interactive content just to expose it to Screen Readers in Forms mode.  It doesn't always work!</p>
