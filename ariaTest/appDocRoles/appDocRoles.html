					<p>Marry me. I don't criticize you! And if you're worried about criticism, sometimes a diet is the best defense. I hear the jury's still out on science. But I bought a yearbook ad from you, doesn't that mean anything anymore?</p>
					<p>As you may or may not know, Lindsay and I have hit a bit of a rough patch. Bad news. Andy Griffith turned us down. <strong> He didn't like his trailer.</strong> <em> I'm afraid I just blue myself.</em> As you may or may not know, Lindsay and I have hit a bit of a rough patch.</p>
					<h2>Oh, you're gonna be in a coma, all right.</h2>
					<p>But I bought a yearbook ad from you, doesn't that mean anything anymore? It's called 'taking advantage.' It's what gets you ahead in life. I don't understand the question, and I won't respond to it. That's what it said on 'Ask Jeeves.'</p>

					<p>Bad news. Andy Griffith turned us down. He didn't like his trailer. I'm half machine. I'm a monster. But I bought a yearbook ad from you, doesn't that mean anything anymore? There's only one man I've ever called a coward, and that's Brian Doyle Murray. No, what I'm calling you is a television actor.</p>

					<h1>Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk!</h1>
					<p>I videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I may blackmail them later. I'm Santa Claus! Maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you are pretending to be. Kids have names?</p>
					<p>Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm going to come back there and change your opinions manually! <strong> No!</strong> <em> The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires!</em> Maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you are pretending to be.</p>
					<h2>I'm a thing.</h2>
					<p>Oh sure! Blame the wizards! I'm a thing. A true inspiration for the children. What are their names? I haven't felt much of anything since my guinea pig died. I had more, but you go ahead.</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Hey, what kinda party is this? There's no booze and only one hooker.</li>

					<h3>You guys go on without me! I'm going to goâ€¦ look for more stuff to steal!</h3>
					<p>Who are those horrible orange men? Morbo can't understand his teleprompter because he forgot how you say that letter that's shaped like a man wearing a hat. I don't 'need' to drink. I can quit anytime I want!</p>

						<li>Bite my shiny metal ass.</li>
						<li>There's no part of that sentence I didn't like!</li>
						<li>I can explain. It's very valuable.</li>

					<p>Ah, the 'Breakfast Club' soundtrack! I can't wait til I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff! Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar. And from now on you're all named Bender Jr.</p>
